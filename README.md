# TheSlide

Welcome to my project! This is an angular 2 rc4 web game where the user needs to balance an object on a see-saw using the phone's accelerometer. The phone sends POST requests to a php hosted website. The angular project then uses GET requests to get the accelerometer data from the aforementioned website
